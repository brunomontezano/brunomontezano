📖 I graduated in a Technical Course in Computer Science at [IFRS](https://ifrs.edu.br/), Bachelor in Psychology at [UCPel](https://ucpel.edu.br/) and I'm a Master in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences from Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ([UFRGS](http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs/inicial)). Currently, I'm a PhD Student in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the [UFRGS](http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs/inicial) (2023), Brazil. I work mainly with statistical computing and data analysis, with focus on mood disorders.

💻 I love programming, and especially working on data science projects using R and Python. Basically what populates my GitHub repos. Besides that, I'm really into free and open source projects in general and advocate for that philosophy in the *tech* world.

I also have a [personal website](https://brunomontezano.github.io/) with my related links and CV.
